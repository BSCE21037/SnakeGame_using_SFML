# SnakeGame_using_SFML
This is the snake game made by SFML(Simple and Fast Multimedia Library), library of C++. I will try to improve this with time to time. 
The game starts by four blocks of snake. Fruits generate randomly on screen one by one and the snake grows accordingly.
Control the snake's movement using the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) on your keyboard.
